        <h1>MyFlix API and architectured database</h1>
        <p>Server-side component of MyFlix, a "movies" web application. MyFlix will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favourite movies.</p>
        <p>Server-side includes the server, business logic, and business layers of the application. It will consist of a well-designed REST API and architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The REST API will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods (CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from the database and store that data in a non-relational way.</p>
